# Muni_Tech
The whole procedure of complaining about a particular issue and then resolution of the same by the Municipality is quite hectic and complex. 
In order to speed up this process and make things transparent we have developed our Web Application Muni-Tech.
Through this platform any individual can just upload the picture of a place which is poorly maintained and not been taken care of, leading to it's detrimental condition.
The platform would simultaneously record the location from where the picture has been uploaded and would notify the municipality.
The municipality after completing it's required task would upload the picture of the same place as to how it looks after they have done their work.
In this way the whole procedure of municipality works would get easier and less time consuming. Moreover the work of the municipality would become very much transparent.
The spirit of self reliance and self help would be imbibed by the people henceforth because they would be responsible for their welfare.
